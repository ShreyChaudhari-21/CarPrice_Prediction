# Car Price Prediction
## 📌 Introduction
This is a Kaggle dataset contains information about used cars listed on [www.cardekho.com]
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:
* 1.Name
* 2.Year
* 3.Selling_price
* 4.Km_driven
* 5.Fuel
* 6.Seller_type
* 7.Transmission
* 8.Owner

This projects shows how to apply linear regression to make used car prices prediction.
First we went threw and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), then feature selection then modeling and finally evaluating our model using difirent metrics and diffirent techniques.
